# AP Computer Science A - Unit 3 Section 5

# Compound Boolean Expressions

This section introduces an addition to our versatile `if` and `if-else` statements: the `else if` statement, which will allow us to even more selectively run lines of code as needed.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- `if-else if` Statements
- `if-else if-else` Statements
- `if-else if-...-else if-else` Statements
- Wrap-Up

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
